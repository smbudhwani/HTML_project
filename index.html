           <h2>About Generation</h2>

              <p>Generation USA transforms education to employment systems to prepare, place, and support people into life-changing careers that would otherwise be inaccessible. The global pandemic has led to an unprecedented surge in unemployment — 375 million workers of all ages needed to learn new skills by 2030. At the same time, jobs remain in high demand, and employers say a skills shortage leaves them with vacancies. Generation USA is a 501(c)(3), charitable organization. </p>

          <p>New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Ellis Island commonly visited by tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn’t unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was named after The New York Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.  </p> </article>
